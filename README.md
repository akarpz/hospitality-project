#Hospitality Webstack

A web app that allows users to input information about community service hours that they have performed for UD's Hospitality department.
The app will have a view for Students to input their hours and check on status, 
supervisors who will fill out a separate form to approve hours performed,
and internal users who will need to see all information in a simplistic form.
