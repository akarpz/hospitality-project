            The hospitality industry is a very people-oriented 
            profession. As such it has been traditionally involved
            with many aspects of community service and support. It is our
            intent to expose all of our students to this vitally important 
            role of the industry through the academic requirement of one 
            hundred hours experience.

            Recognizing that there are many venues of service to fulfill these 
            hours, it becomes necessary to generally define community service.  
            By definition, community service shall include activities for which 
            you volunteer, and which are intended to provide aid and support to 
            those in need and/or for the improvement of the community as a whole.  
            Those activities that specifically benefit you or your organization 
            financially shall not be accepted.
            <br>
            <br>
            Examples of community service may include activity involvement with 
            the following types of non-profit agencies:

        <div align="left">
            <ul>
                <li>animal shelters</li>
                <li>community dining rooms</li>
                <li>crisis centers</li> 
                <li>disaster assistance organizations</li>
                <li>disease related organizations</li>
                <li>food banks</li>
                <li>group homes</li>
                <li>homeless shelters</li>
                <li>medical support and assistance groups(hospital)</li>
                <li>municipal community organizations</li>
                <li>religious aid groups</li>
                <li>senior centers and youth groups.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div align="justify">
            Each community service activity requires a Documentation of 
            Community Service form.
            <br>
            <br>
            Acceptable non-profit agency supervisor signatures from community 
            service events (including Sorority and Fraternity events) should not 
            be students or relatives.
            <br>
            <br>
            Certain community service events have a limit on the number of 
            community service hours that will be accepted:
            <br>
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>UDance-maximum 10 hours of community service per year</li>
                <li>Food drives-maximum 4 hours[20 cans] per event 
                {5 cans = 1 hour}</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            When you sign up to volunteer for an event, the organization is 
            counting on your participation. Therefore, if you sign up to 
            volunteer for an event and do not participate, five hours of 
            community service will be deducted from your total hours.
